# Day 2: MOJO Programming for AI Development

Welcome to **Day 2** of the MOJO Programming for AI Development course! On this day, we delve into functions, argument conventions, data collections, methods, constructors, and method overloading in MOJO. Below you'll find a series of programs designed to practice and master these concepts.

## üìö Programs Overview

Here are the programs you'll work on for Day 2, with their respective files linked:

1. **Find the factorial of a given number using recursion.**
   - [**1.mojo**](./1.mojo)

2. **Define a global variable and show how it can be accessed and modified from different functions. Also, define a local variable within a function and demonstrate how it retains its value between function calls but is not accessible outside the function.**
   - [**2.mojo**](./2.mojo)

3. **Example program for declaring arguments with a default value and performing some mathematical operations.**
   - [**check.ipynb**](./check.ipynb)

4. **Add two numbers using normal parameter declaration, inout, and borrowed argument conventions. Also, print the original values in the main code after calling each function.**
   - [**check.ipynb**](./check.ipynb)

5. **Demonstrate struct to print student details with a constructor.**
   - [**check.ipynb**](./check.ipynb)

6. **Demonstrate a constructor for allocating memory and a special function to deallocate the memory using struct.**
   - [**check.ipynb**](./check.ipynb)

7. **Demonstrate multiple constructors with the help of method overloading.**
   - [**check.ipynb**](./check.ipynb)

## üìù Getting Started

1. **Install MOJO:**
   - Visit the [MOJO Installation Guide](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/manual/installation) for instructions on installing MOJO on your system.

2. **Explore MOJO Documentation:**
   - Check out the [MOJO Language Documentation](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/manual/) to understand the syntax and features of MOJO.

3. **Run the Programs:**
   - Use the [MOJO Playground](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/playground) to run and test the provided `.mojo` files.

4. **Check the Notebook:**
   - Open and review the Jupyter Notebook `check.ipynb` to see examples and solutions for tasks 3 through 7.
